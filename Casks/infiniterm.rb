# Homebrew cask for infiniterm: terminal cards on an infinite canvas, with
# each coding agent's state on its card's border.
#
# The DMG on ekinertac/infiniterm's releases is signed with a Developer ID and
# notarized, so unlike walter.rb there is no quarantine workaround. The app
# updates itself (checks every six hours, installs on restart), hence
# auto_updates: `brew upgrade` leaves it alone and this file only has to be
# current for fresh installs. Release tags are v<version> and the DMG names
# the build, so the version is "<version>,<build>" and the csv parts rebuild the URL.
#
# `ift`, the command line side, ships inside the bundle and is linked onto
# the PATH here; `ift install` does the same by hand for DMG installs.
